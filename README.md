# Talon Voice Diagram Drawing
Work in progress diagram drawing talon commands currently compatible with Vectr. Undocumented commands might undergo serious change.

Proper documentation is in progress.

# Canvas
For some functionality to work, you must use commands to specify the upper left and bottom right corners of the canvas you will be drawing on. You specify the upper left corner by moving the mouse to it and saying "update canvas origin". You specify the bottom right corner by moving the mouse to it and saying "update canvas ending".

The canvas is remembered on a per application basis, so you do not have to respecify it every time you switch between supported drawing applications.

The canvas specifying commands can be found in canvas.talon.
